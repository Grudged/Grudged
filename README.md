# Hey, I'm Chris 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on building clean, efficient tools that solve real-world problems — from dashboards and backend scripts to automating repetitive tasks. I'm freelancing while finishing my degree, and loving every minute of building things that actually help people.

## 💡 What I Build
- 🧠 Real-time dashboards with Angular, MQTT, and Highcharts
- 🛠 Automation scripts with Python and Power Automate
- 📊 Data tools and reporting with SQL and backend logic (even ColdFusion!)
- ⚙️ Tools that reduce manual labor and improve visibility for ops teams

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages:** JavaScript, Python, SQL, CFML  
**Frameworks & Tools:** Angular, Highcharts, Power Automate, Node.js, MQTT, Git  
**Databases:** Oracle, SQLite, MSSQL

## 🚀 Freelance Focus
Right now I'm freelancing part-time while studying software engineering — looking for gigs that let me grow, solve problems, and build something useful.
